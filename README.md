# GloomEngine
This is an attempt at creating the doom engine

# What are my goals?
My goals here are to actually in depth understand what is going on inside the Doom engine,
and hopefully be able to create a rather simple game within my version of this game engine!

I hope to be able to have a string understanding behind the conepts and math with what is happening in the engine itself,
particularly the 'camera' and maybe adding in the walls that are not 90 degrees.

Learning Binary Space Partitioning would also be something I want to earn as this is what they use to make the game run that bit faster,
although with the computers of today I don't think it is necessary as we can virtually run this game on a graphics calculator!

This project will be fully open source and available to anyone to have a look at as I make progress in the engine!

# What's the plan?
My plan is that I will create a simple level editor and then create the actual game system,
this will in the process llow me to be able to figure out what I like and don't like in this game engine making adjustments as I go.

I also hop that when I am done with this game engine I will be able to create a game similar to Doom/Wolfenstein-3D

# Features I want in this game engine!

Here are some of the features I wish to add!

- Multiplayer functionality creation
- Simple Level Editing
- Adding events to the map (interacations etc)
- Creating and placing enemies
- Placement of weapons, powerups and items
- Light placement
- Animation of the Walls and other Environment

These are some of the features I would like to add to the engine!
These are all similar to what Doom had in it so these would be some of the aspects I would liek to implement as well.
